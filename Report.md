## Comparison

Jenkins and CircleCi essentially have the same functionallity, and their major difference comes from ease of use. CircleCi allows for easier implementation when it comes to small teams and does not require much knowledge of Docker while Jenkins requires a greater understanding of it. The downside of CircleCi is that it gives slightly less control than Docker and has slightly longer build times due to it automatically running after every push from GitHub. Speaking of Github, CircleCi is also allows easy integration with Github. The automatic builds however can be a nice feature as Jenkins requires manual builds. The final major difference comes from sharing with team members. CircleCi allows you to share the workflow with a link while Jenkins requires you to host the Jenkins container on a server which will require more work.
